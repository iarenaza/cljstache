Cljstache
=========
{{ [mustache](http://mustache.github.com) }} templates for Clojure[Script].

Compliant with the [Mustache spec](http://github.com/mustache/spec),
including lambdas (jvm only)

Forked from [clostache](https://github.com/fhd/clostache) and updated to be compatible with ClojureScript.

Usage
-----

To render a template, just pass a template string and a map of data to `render`:

```clj
(require '[cljstache.core :refer [render]])

(render "Hello, {{name}}!" {:name "Felix"})
```

On the JVM, you can also render a resource from the classpath like this:

```clj
(require '[cljstache.core :refer [render-resource]])

(render-resource "templates/hello.mustache" {:name "Michael"})
```

Both of these functions support an optional third argument, containing partials (see below).

Examples
--------

### Variable replacement ###

Variables are tags enclosed by two curly brackets (*mustaches*) and
will be replaced with the respective data.

Template:

```mustache
Hello, {{person}}!
```

Data:

```clj
{:person "World"}
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Escaped output ###

The following characters will be replaced with HTML entities:
`&"<>`. Tags that use three curly brackets or start with `{{&` will
not be escaped.

Template:

```mustache
Escaped: {{html}}
Unescaped: {{{html}}}
Unescaped: {{&html}}
```

Data:

```clj
{:html "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"}
```

Output:

```html
Escaped: &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
Unescaped: <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
Unescaped: <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

### Sections ###

Sections start with a tag beginning with `{{#` and end with one
beginning with `{{/`. Their content is only rendered if the data is
either the boolean value `true`, a value or a non-empty list.

Template:

```mustache
{{#greet}}Hello, World!{{/greet}}
```

Data:

```clj
{:greet true}
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

In case of a list, the section's content is rendered for each element,
and it can contain tags refering to the elements.

Template:

```mustache
<ul>
{{#people}}
    <li>{{name}}</li>
{{/people}}
</ul>
```

Data:

```clj
{:people [{:name "Felix"} {:name "Jenny"}]}
```

Output:

```html
<ul>
    <li>Felix</li>
    <li>Jenny</li>
</ul>
```

For single values, the section is rendered exactly once.

Template:

```mustache
{{#greeting}}{{text}}!{{/greeting}}
```

Data:

```clj
{:greeting {:text "Hello, World"}}
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Inverted sections ###

Inverted sections start with a tag beginning with `{{^` and end with one
beginning with `{{/`. Their content is only rendered if the data is
either the boolean value `false` or an empty list.

Template:

```mustache
{{^ignore}}Hello, World!{{/ignore}}
```

Data:

```clj
{:ignore false}
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

### Comments ###

Comments are tags that begin with `{{!`. They will not be rendered.

Template:

```mustache
<h2>Felix' section<h2>
{{! Look ma, I've written a section }}
```

Output:

```html
<h2>Felix' section</h2>
```

### Dotted names ###

Dotted names are a shorter and more convenient way of accessing nested
variables or sections.

Template:

```mustache
{{greeting.text}}
```

Data:

```clj
{:greeting {:text "Hello, World"}}
```

Output:

```
Hello, World
```

### Implicit iterators ###

Implicit iterators allow you to iterate over a one dimensional list of
elements.

Template:

```mustache
<ul>
{{#names}}
    <li>{{.}}</li>
{{/names}}
</ul>
```

Data:

```clj
{:names ["Felix" "Jenny"]}
```

Output:

```html
<ul>
    <li>Felix</li>
    <li>Jenny</li>
</ul>
```

### Partials ###

Partials allow you to include other templates (e.g. from separate files).

Template:

```mustache
Hello{{>names}}!
```

Data:

```clj
{:people [{:name "Felix"} {:name "Jenny"}]}
```

Partials:

```mustache
{:names "{{#people}}, {{name}}{{/people}}"}
```

Output:

```
Hello, Felix, Jenny!
```

#### Using Partials as Includes

You can use partials as "includes" to build up a document from other pieces.
For example, when building a web page, you can have header and footer template
files that are included in the main page template. This document describes one
way to do that.

In your project directory (let's call it "my-proj"), create a "resources"
directory if you don't already have one. Then,

```sh
cd path/to/my-proj/resources
mkdir templates
cd templates
touch header.mustache footer.mustache my-page.mustache
```

Make header.mustache look something like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head><title>{{my-title}}</title></head>
<body>
<p>header here!</p>
```

and footer.mustache look something like:

```html
<p>footer here!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Edit my-page.mustache to contain:

```html
{{> header}}

<h1>{{my-title}}</h1>

<p>Learn about {{stuff}} here.</p>

{{> footer}}
```

Now, in your source code (in a Compojure project, this might be
my-proj/src/my_proj/handler.clj), in the `ns` macro's :require
vector, add

```clojure
[clostache.parser :refer [render-resource]]
[clojure.java.io :as io]
```

then create a `render-page` helper function:

```clojure
(defn render-page
  "Pass in the template name (a string, sans its .mustache
filename extension), the data for the template (a map), and a list of
partials (keywords) corresponding to like-named template filenames."
  [template data partials]
  (render-resource
    (str "templates/" template ".mustache")
    data
    (reduce (fn [accum pt] ;; "pt" is the name (as a keyword) of the partial.
              (assoc accum pt (slurp (io/resource (str "templates/"
                                                       (name pt)
                                                       ".mustache")))))
            {}
            partials)))
```

(thanks to samflores for that idea â˜º). You'd then call this function like so:

```clojure
(render-page "my-page"
             {:my-title "My Title" :stuff "giraffes"}
             [:header :footer]))
```

Note that the value for :my-title which you pass in makes its way
not only into the my-page.mustache template, but also down into
the included header.mustache.

### Set delimiters ###

You don't have to use mustaches, you can change the delimiters to
anything you like.

Template:

```mustache
{{=<% %>=}}
Hello, <%name%>!
```

Data:

```clj
{:name "Felix"}
```

Output:

```
Hello, Felix!
```

### Lambdas ###

You can also call functions from templates.

Template:

```mustache
{{hello}}
{{#greet}}Felix{{/greet}}
```

Data:

```clj
{:hello "Hello, World!"}
{:greet #(str "Hello, " %)}
```


Output:

```
Hello, World!
Hello, Felix!
```

Functions can also render the text given to them if they need to do something more complicated.

Template:

```mustache
"{{#people}}Hi {{#upper}}{{name}}{{/upper}}{{/people}}"
```

Data:
```clj
{:people [{:name "Felix"}]
 :upper (fn [text]
          (fn [render-fn]
            (clojure.string/upper-case (render-fn text))))}
```

Output:

```
Hello FELIX
```

Development
-----------

Make sure you have
[Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Upgrading)
installed.

To run the spec tests, fetch them like this:

```
git submodule update --init
```

And run them against all supported Clojure versions:

```
lein test-all
```

Requirements
------------

As cljstache uses Clojure's reader conditionals, cljstache is dependent on both Clojure 1.7 and Leiningen 2.5.2 or later.
Java 8 or greater is required to run the clojurescript tests (using Nashorn.)
